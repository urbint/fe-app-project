# FE Template app

This Repo is an example template to be used to create new nextjs projects for Urbint.
The template was created using nextjs framework and the tools we are using in our projects for tests, lints and so on.

To start a new project using this template you should run:

```
yarn create next-app <project-name> -e https://github.com/urbint/fe-app-project
```

This command will create a folder with the <project-name> and the necessary files and configurations.

> Your project name should not have space and should be all lower-case.

# NextJS commands

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
